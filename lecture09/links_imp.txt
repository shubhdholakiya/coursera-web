we can define links with "a" tags
which has href inside it, href stands for hypertext refrence.

We can use div tag inside "a" tag so if we click in whole region then too the link will be opened.

we can put target="_blank" so it will open link in new tab or window.(external link example) 

Same-page-links:

And as you could see, the links that have set up here all have a very specific format in the href attribute. It's a # followed by some name like section1, section2, and so on. Now what these links are pointing to is a section of our page. Now you could identify a section a couple of different ways. You can have in any tag that has an id with that section name. Notice that the section name does not contain the # sign. Only the link to that section contains the # sign. That's one way to identify a section within the page. Another way is, if we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page, is to create an anchor tag with a name attribute and name the section very similarly to the way you name a section id. The way you refer to these sections is exactly the same, you put a # in front of the name of the section and stick that value in the href attribute of an anchor tag. 
- Best for single page applications.
